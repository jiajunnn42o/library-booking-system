# Library Booking System  
## Iteration 3 â€“ Admin Panel & Book Management

In this iteration, an **admin role** is introduced to manage the system via a dedicated dashboard. The admin can add, delete, and view all books and reservations. This separates user and admin privileges effectively and prepares the system for real-world scalability.
